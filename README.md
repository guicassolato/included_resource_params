# TrustYou's Ruby coding test
This is an alternative solution to TrustYou's Ruby coding test. A couple months after implementing it, I decided to push it to this repository for didatic purposes.

The Ruby coding test by TrustYou is a public Ruby test, quise easy to solve, but still powerful to demonstrate the way you think as a programmer. The description of the test can be found at http://codepad.org/fimc6VHa.
Applicants are invited to post their solutions publicly on [codepad](http://codepad.org) or as a GitHub [gist](https://gist.github.com), and to submit the link [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScjfAimBQaBWgH_2m9PR7JGVXzm3ahHDYyjbskE3sqkJhIY5g/viewform). Several different approaches can found on the web.

## License
Although TrustYou hasn't really registerred the challenge under any public license that we know, it seems reasonable to always give the credits. So, if you decide to share you thoughts about TrustYou's IncludedResourceParams, it is always nice to mention the authors and include the links above.

Besides that, please feel free to clone it, improve it and share it independently as you wish.

## Support
No support will be provided. Use it at your own risk. But if you need to get in touch for any other reason or you have significant improvement advices to share, please open an issue and I promise I'll try to respond it as soon as possible.
